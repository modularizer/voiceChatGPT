# VoiceChatGPT
This project uses builtin javascript webkit utility to turn [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) into a voice assistant.

Most of the code and comments were written by ChatGPT. In fact, I was not even aware that Chrome could do speech-to-text.

## To use:

### Using Developer Console
    1. navigate to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)
    2. Open the developer console
    3. Copy-paste the content of voiceChatGPT.js into the developer console
    4. talk
    5. If the code is buggy, use ChatGPT to help fix the code, then pull request your changes!!
